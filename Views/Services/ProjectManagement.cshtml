                    </h3>

                        Embracing Future
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        As the one-size-fits-all trend slowly fades, the traditional waterfall methodologies are now being replaced with modern agile strategies. These modern or even hybrid strategies are best suited for scenarios where the business projects are to be managed over a vast work base and there is imperative requirement of multiple project managers. Thus, the present corporate business work is looking for project managers who are equipped with the right knowledge and skill to handle hybrid project management strategies. Besides, the managers should not exclusively be working for one prescriptive methodology but are well-versed in multiple methodologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the wake of new project management methodologies evolving across industries, project managers are now implementing collaborative, mobile, and social networking tools to carry out tasks from anywhere, anytime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As companies are investing heavily in technology-enabled project management software, our aim with this special edition on project management technology is to help you attain more visibility into your project progress lifecycle.
